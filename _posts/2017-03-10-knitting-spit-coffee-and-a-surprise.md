Things around here have been plodding along. Nothing really new to report, other than a bit of news I'll share at the end of this post. I wondered about days like this before I even started this blog. Days where things are just ... normal. I'm sure our version of normal isn't everyone's cup of tea, just as I don't feel

is "the best part of waking up" and meeting the Queen of England [wouldn't be my idea of a good time](https://jezebel.com/this-child-doesnt-care-to-meet-the-bloody-queen-thank-1793153213){:target="_blank}. But I guess the whole point of a blog is for a sneak peek into other's lives. That's why I read the blogs I like. Yes, for hints and tips and recipes and reassurance that I'm not the only one who feels failure at a [lack of guinea fowl giftedness](http://ffwife.weebly.com/blog/it-just-didnt-work-out){:target="_blank"} or is seriously considering [burying underwear](https://www.realagriculture.com/2017/02/healthy-soil-will-eat-your-underwear/){:target="_blank"}.

I have already started on another two pairs. It's so addicting! #MustKnitAllTheSocks

The only real excitement lately is this: We are currently looking for a surveyor to plot our land so that we can get some major fencing erected. I'm envisioning a fence-raising shindig. Now, this might not seem that interesting or even important, except for the reason WHY we need the fencing. I won't spoil the moment, but let's just say that not having fencing would be baa-d. (Yep. Bad jokes. I got em.)

Stay tuned and I'll let you know when the big moment (for us anyway) arrives.
