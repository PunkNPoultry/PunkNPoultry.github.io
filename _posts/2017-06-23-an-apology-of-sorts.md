I was a jackass.

In my previous post I hinted at something big. Something farm-changing. Something exciting and new. Something that would open up a whole new world for us. And then ...

I didn't post.

I know you thought I was going to propose a more permanent situation between us - maybe subscription-based - but I think we have a good thing going with what we have. And I wasn't trying to lead you on.

You and I are special. We have a non-binding commitment to each other. Till blog-death do we part (or at least until we get bored.)

And it's not like you haven't been reading other blogs. (I know all about them.) Blogs about homesteading or cooking. Blogs that are a little classier, a little more refined. But your side-blogs can never replace our bond.

So just consider this an apology for being temporarily distracted.

It's not you, it's me.

Now, let's turn on some soft music and have a little [makeup reading]({% link _posts/2017-06-23-baaa-freaking-baaa.md %}) shall we? You know you want it. I promise to be gentle.
