Punk N Poultry Farm won’t sell you visions of the quiet country life.

We’re more into the Buzzcocks than the bucolic, but we share the same vision as the Eat Local hipster crowd. Those smug bastards are onto something: sustainably-produced food that is grown well, farmed well and tastes good.

We offer:

* Vegetables that haven’t absorbed so many chemicals they glow
* Eggs straight from a free-ranging chicken’s butt to your table
* Heritage-breed duck that gets fat on farm pests, and aren’t kept in confinement

What we don’t deliver in homespun charm, we make up for in hard work and delicious food.
